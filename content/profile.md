I'm a mild-mannered developer and technology advocate by day... and, well, by night too, I suppose.

Shortly after it arrived at my home in 1993 I began disassembling my first computer - my mother was not happy. She breathed more easily when I moved from hardware into programming. My experience includes development and instruction at startups, agencies, Fortune 100 companies, and universities, as well as numerous open source projects. My programming experience includes JavaScript (and Node.js), PHP, Java, Natural, and more. I speak regularly at (and helps organize) local user groups and conferences big and small. My primary mission for over 10 years has been to evangelize technology of all sorts and share what I've learned to help others grow. In my down time I enjoy puzzles of all sorts and board games!
