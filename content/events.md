In case you're curious, my first conference speaking engagement was a [Knowbility](https://knowbility.org) Web Accessibility conference in Long Beach, California. It was called CalWAC and I spoke on making sites using JavaScript more accessible. Major Thanks to Glenda Sims for hooking me up with that opportunity!
