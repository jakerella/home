## When it rains it pours

I think that statement is one that applies to just about every nook and cranny of our lives. In my experience, any time something goes well or poorly, it occurs in droves. For example, a few years ago some of my family began experiencing medical problems. All of them were unrelated, but they all came within a year of each other. Some people say that bad things happen in threes, but I don't think there is a specific number assigned to the "pouring."

This week I am extraordinarily busy. A small part of that is due to my procrastination, but a significant piece is simply due to a confluence of various projects - or at least pieces of them. One was delayed for a short while, one began on time, but didn't get rolling until this past Friday, and one I procrastinated on. There are three other projects that need my attention this week as well, they aren't things I need to finish, but definitely things that will impact my overall availability. It is indeed pouring.

Of course, this is only my professional responsibilities, and it does not take into account the fact that my wife and I have also just put our house on the market, making for a daily top-to-bottom cleaning ritual to make the house presentable to potential buyers. I really don't need that added stress right now, but it is the right time for us to put it up (I think).

While this may seem like a rant, it is more of a long, drawn out question: Why do things (tasks, medical issues, etc.) seem to congregate temporally? Is it an artifact of the human sub-conscience, trying to tell us something? And if so, what? If not, why the hell does it happen? (And no, I will not entertain an answer of "a test by some god.")
