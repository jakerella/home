## Starting out

I'm rededicating this blog in light of recent events. You see, last week was my last in the traditional workforce. I will be using my talents on some of my own projects (more on those later), as well as to educate others. This isn't an entirely new experience for me as I've been freelancing for a while now, but it will be new in that I am doing so without having a "real job" or in school at the same time.

I plan to use this blog to record my adventures into self employment, and to document some of my difficulties and accomplishments. Feel free to contact me if you feel like it, I'd love to hear feedback on your own experiences.
