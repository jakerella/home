## Trudging forward

I'm in the thick of it now. I'm teaching classes every week, 2 or 3 days each; one client is moving forward with a custom WordPress-powered site (custom as in new, custom theme);[ Track the Pig](http://trackthepig.com) (my main other project) is getting close to ready to alpha release (hoping to do so before [SXSWi](http://sxsw.com/interactive)); and I have 3 other potential clients in the wings. One of these keeps emailing me to ask when we can start. This is all good of course; I'm staying busy, generating good client relationships and this potential future business through word of mouth. But at times I get lost in it all and yearn for a manager to tell me what my priorities are.

Then I remember everything else that manager would tell me, and how little choice I have in any of those matters.

So I'm pushing on, haven't thrown in the towel yet; although it helps tremendously to have a supportive significant other, and that's true in many ways. Not only do we have a full income to use for bills, etc. (menaing my income is ancellary), but it also helps to have someone who believes that you can do what you are trying to do. Beyond that, there's also the support of friends and family in many capacities. My dad is helping with working on marketing Track the Pig (and the company I'm forming to hold it); and my friends helped get me the teaching contract that I have right now.

Not a lot else to update with... other than the hordes of personal intrusions in my work time (selling our house, getting ready to move, taking care of the animals, groceries, etc., etc., etc.).
