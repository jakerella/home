## Distractions

Last week was not the best in terms of tasks accomplished (work tasks anyway). I did get some things done on a couple of projects, but there were distractions all around. I spent a lot fo time doing house work (cleaning, fixing up a guest room, etc.) in preparation for a visit from my dad, who lives out of state and thus I don't get to see him often. I also needed to run some errands out of the house.

A lot of these things could have been done after "work hours", but I did them during the day instead. This probably isn't the best idea for every task (regardless of what I said last week in my update) because I usually don't work after normal "work hours", so this just eats into my time. I think I need to do a better job of realizing when things _need_ to be done during the day - or when I need a break, and they can be done relatively quickly.

For now, I just need to get back on track, even with the short week for Thanksgiving. I plan to not work (or not much) on Thursday for the holiday, and Friday my wife will be home, so I probably won't get much done (but I'll try anyway).
